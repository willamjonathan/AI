For our task, we utilized the Tensorflow Keras library to conduct deep learning on our dataset of famous painters and their paintings based on the given DL pipeline. Our final project is to use this deep learning model and algorithm to create a program that is able to predict famous painters based on their works with adequate to great accuracy.

## Dataset and Model
Unfortunately, due to the size of our dataset and model, GitHub doesn't allow their upload as it exceeds the file size limit. Thus, you can access our 'input' folder which contains our dataset and also the saved model from the process run from the link attached or click [ here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nIevwbPH15diqeYq-IEXBGtGoli85TJi?usp=sharing

## Additional Notes
We used .ipynb format instead of .py so we can easily debug and run the process while being able to save and display the output of the last process run so readers can see the final output. This is because due to the size of our dataset processing and the whole code run, the full runtime of the code takes hours.
